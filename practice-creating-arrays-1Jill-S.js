let groceryList = ["tortilla chips", "tomatoes", "avocados", "jalepenos", "onions"];
let prices = [3.59, 1.25, 2.50];
let sportsTeams = ["Blues", "Cardinals", "Chiefs"];

console.log(groceryList);
console.log(prices);
console.log(sportsTeams[1]);
console.log(groceryList[0]);
console.log(groceryList[3]);
console.log(prices[0]);
console.log(prices[2]);
